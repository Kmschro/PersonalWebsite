    <h2>Personal Bio</h2>
    <p>I am originally from Norwalk, Connecticut but I was born in peekskill, New York. Some of my hobbies include playing baseball, basketball, and fishing. When it comes to my professional career, I have particpated in two internships with IBM over during the summers of 2021 and 2022. I was able to particpate in these internships through a partnership with IBM and my high school. Along with partcipating in two internships, during high school I was able to complete college courses all expenses paid by IBM with my high school courses. In May 2022 I was able to graduate with an associate's degree in web development a month before I graduated high school.</p>
