    <h2>Personal Bio</h2>
    <p>My name is Klaus Schroeder and I am a driven individual currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science Degree in Computer Science at Quinnipiac University, Hamden, Connecticut, with an expected graduation in May 2025. I hold an Associate degree in web development from Norwalk Community College, where I graduated Cum Laude in 2022. Prior to that, I completed my High School Diploma at P-TECH High School, Norwalk, Connecticut, graduating with a 4.1 GPA and membership in the National Honor Society. </p>

    <p>My professional journey includes valuable experiences such as my role as a Retail/Pharmacy Associate at CVS from June 2023 to August 2023. During this time, I prioritized positive customer experiences through attentive service, maintained accurate cash transactions, and ensured a well-organized and visually appealing store environment.</p>
      
    <p> I also had the opportunity to intern at IBM, where I worked in the Energy Resources Division in the summer of 2022. My responsibilities included conducting interviews with renewable energy stakeholders, contributing to the design of a user interface for energy monitoring, and delivering a final presentation outlining our project objectives and solutions. Additionally, I contributed significantly to the IBM Cloud and Cognitive Division in the summer of 2021, where my team's innovative use of chatbots earned us 1st place in the IBM Internship Expo.</p>
      
    <p>My skill set includes proficiency in HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript, Git, GitHub, and PHP, alongside strong familiarity with Microsoft Office and Google Suite. I possess excellent communication skills, both written and verbal, and thrive in collaborative, goal-oriented environments. Additionally, my ability to remain composed under pressure enables me to effectively navigate challenging situations.</p>
      
    <p>I am eager to leverage my skills and experiences to contribute meaningfully to dynamic and innovative teams, and I am excited to explore new opportunities in the field of computer science and web development.</p>
